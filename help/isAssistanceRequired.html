	In this instance we are trying to identify photos showing people requiring assistance and support in order to assess their
	safety and security. To answer this question you should look for people in need of different forms of assistance and for
	photos showing any gap in measures that ensure safety and security for displaced people. Examples of when you should
	click <button class="btn btn-xs btn-success" disabled>Yes</button> include photos showing people requiring food, cash,
	WASH (water, latrines, etc.), shelter, and health and nutrition items.
	You should also click <button class="btn btn-xs btn-success" disabled>Yes</button> if you see any evidence of hazardous
	material contamination or waste that pose potential threats to public health or the environment, as well as evidence of
	people breaking the law.
